This game was created during [GMTK Game Jam 2020](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2020)

In "Last Meow Standing" you fight evil Space Mice as a brave Space Cat using an awesome arsenal of deadly weapons... and a banana gun.

## Controls

- Press `WASD` or arrow keys to move
- Press `Space` to perform a dash move
- Use `mouse` to aim and `left mouse` to shoot

## Health System
But beware! Every hit you take takes away a random component of your weapon arsenal or movement controls (dash, movement directions).

In the end, you will be the Last Meow Standing - no movement controls whatsoever.

* CATling Gun
* RocCat Launcher
* 3-barrel Shotgun
* a mysterious banana gun...

You will get a pistol when you are the Last Meow Standing.
